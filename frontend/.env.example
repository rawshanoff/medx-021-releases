# Prefer leaving VITE_API_URL empty and using the dev proxy (/api -> backend),
# so the frontend doesn't hardcode a port.
# If you want to bypass proxy, set a full URL like:
# VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8002/api
VITE_API_URL=

# Dev proxy target for Vite (used only by vite.config.ts)
VITE_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8000
